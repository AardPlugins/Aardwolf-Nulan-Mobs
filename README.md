# Aardwolf-Nulan-Mobs

Mushclient plugin for getting hidden Nulan mobs

Nulan has a number of mobs that will disappear depending on the time of day.  Once you have completed the area goal, you can give items to the Hunter who will find mobs that can't be reached.

This plugin expects you to have the following items:

a songbird feather
a feather of a grouse
badger fur
an eagle feather
a white owl feather
Wolf tooth
fur of a prairie dog
tail of a deer mouse

These items can be found by killing mobs in the area.
